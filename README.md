# Comparing results between DNN and ML models on a simple dataset.

Aim

Using a large marketing campaigns data set of over 45 thousand rows, I aim to test the prediction accuracy of 4 different designed neural networks against 4 machine learning algorithms (SVM, Logistic regression, Random forest, Soft Voting classifier and Hard voting classifier) on a simple dataset to see whether DNN can be suited for small scale applications.
